      <h3 class="hed-b">Contributing, Bug Reports, and More Information</h3>
      <p>For more information on the development of Boxart and how you can file bugs or contribute fixes, check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/bocoup/rwd-game-boiler">GitHub</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="hed-a">Getting Started with Boxart</h2>
    <p>To start working with this repo and build your own responsive, accessible game we recommend you either download the code for the latest release from the releases page, or fork this repo and use git to clone your fork.</p>

    <p>Once the code is on your machine open a terminal in its directory and run <code>npm install</code>; this will install all our dependencies, and you’ll be able to run the project's grunt tasks. To see the site hosted locally run <code>grunt</code>, then visit: <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> in your browser of choice.</p>

    <h3 class="hed-b">Build Tasks</h3>

    <p>The following tasks are provided by this boilerplate for use during development.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <h4 class="ex-hed">default grunt</h4>

        <p>The default grunt task runs webpack-dev-server; a task which hosts your site on a local http server and watches your code for changes. When changes are detected webpack will automatically cut a new build and the code (where possible) will be automatically swapped into the browser, meaning you don't have to refresh the page to see updates. If the code cannot be hotswapped the page will be refreshed so the latest changes are visible. The webpack-dev-server task is configured in the grunt-webpack.js file in the tasks directory, and is setup to read the webpack.config.js file to configure webpack's behavior.</p>

        <p>The default grunt task runs webpack-dev-server; a task which hosts your site on a local http server and watches your code for changes.

      </div>
      
      <div class="example">
        <h4 class="ex-hed"><code>lint grunt lint</code></h4>

        <p>This repo uses eslint to enforce code quality and a consistent style across the project. Running grunt lint will notify you of any possible JS errors or style variations. This task is configured with numerous .eslintrc files that are scattered throughout the repo. Note that none of those files actually define linting rules, instead they reference predefined rule sets which live in the eslint directory.</p>

        <div class="snippet">
          <pre><code>&lt;head>
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/docs.css">
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/glitch.css">
&lt;/head></code></pre>
        </div>

         <p>An .editorconfig file is also provided to help reduce frustrating style errors that could bog down this linting task. If your text editor or IDE supports it, install an editor config plugin.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h4 class="ex-hed"><code>test grunt test</code></h4>

        <p>The test task first lints the code the runs our tests using the karma test runner. Testing in JS typically involves lots of moving parts and this project is no exception: tests leverage the Mocha Testing Framework, and the Chai Assertion Library.</p>

        <p>This task also sets up a watcher that will re-run tests when changes are detected. To run the tests only once the task karma:ci can be used instead, but note it will only run the tests and skip linting.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <h4 class="ex-hed"><code>build grunt build:dev</code></h4>

        <p>The build task uses Webpack to bundle our code for release for a dev environment. Before building this task runs both the lint and karma:ci tasks, to ensure code quality. The webpack.config.build.js file is used to configure webpack's behavior during this task.</p>
